            <h2> Follow </h2>
            <p> Follow and keep updated on your favorite artists. Get notified when they release new music or merchandise, or whenever they hold a concert in your area. New releases open up new discussion posts for you to talk about that band's new release with their other followers.

            <h2> Review </h2>
            <p> After listening to an album, you have the option to leave a 1 to 10 rating score on the album, along with an optional short description behind the rating. You can view ratings other users have made for similar albums, or share and see the reviews of all your friends. These reviews can be private or public.

               <h2> Recommend </h2>
               <p> On your profile, you can post a list of characteristics you are looking for in a song or album, and have other community members recommend you something new to listen to. They can't recommend you something that's already on your "listened to" list, so don't worry about getting repeats
